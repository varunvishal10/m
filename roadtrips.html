              <p>One cannot put forward a list of awesome road trips in India without accounting for one that is taken along a forest. The Bandipur Forest route to Bangalore is one of the most beautiful trips through forests in India, that you'll ever take. One can take the same road to Ooty from Mysore passing though Bandipur National Park. Have a road trip with friends in a car with a sunroof, singing all the way. You might spot deer nonchalantly crossing the road. There's no better manner of paying your respects to this charming highway! <br>
