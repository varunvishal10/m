              <p>"Chadar" refers to the blanket or sheet as the Zanskar river transforms itself from a rapid river into a white blanket of ice during winter making it a magnificent trek in India to embark on. The frozen spectacle awaits the trekker to the experience of glass ice ranging from a bluish tinge to golden yellow that is seen during the few hours that sunlight reaches directly into the gorge to the milky whitish on a moonlit night. Chadar Frozen River trek is said to be one of the best treks in India. This is one of the toughest treks in India and of course, the most adventurous as well.
